## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Cloudinary, JavaScript

I was motivated to develop this project because I often wished I had a resource like this when I was younger. Back then, I often felt lost and overwhelmed by the multitude of choices and uncertainties ahead of me, and I wanted a tool that could help me figure out how I could live a fulfilling life. This app aims to provide that clarity and support, making it easier for others to navigate their own journeys by creating vision boards and setting achievable goals to reach their dreams. My goal was to build a platform where users can explore their passions and make informed choices, just like I wished I could have done in the past.

## Optimizations
- [ ] Improve the 'Goal' section of this app to clarify the process of setting achievable goals. This enhancement will involve providing more comprehensive information, because setting sustainable goals requires much more than just writing a simple list.
- [ ] I also think we could enhance the Profile page by incorporating further details about the app's functionality.
- [ ] Eventually it would be great to enable users to add more than just images to their panels. Giving them the freedom to upload videos, text, or link to web pages could be super beneficial to a users experience.
- [ ] I also want to add lightbox of some way to click on the images without taking them directly to the link.

## Lessons Learned:

This project turned out to be an incredible learning experience. It was my first attempt at creating a login screen, which went really well! I also had the opportunity to use Tailwind CSS extensively for the first time, moving away from my usual vanilla CSS to explore a more modern approach to styling. I also delved into using Cloudinary for image storage, which added another layer of knowledge to my skill set.
