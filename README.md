## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, JavaScript, Tailwind, Express, Node, MongoDB

I was inspired to create this project because I wished I had an app like this while I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to do as a career or just life in general.

## Optimizations

I'd like to expand the 'Goal' area of this app, since there is a lot more to setting sustainable goals, than just a simple list. Additionally, I'd like to do something more with the Profile page. Maybe add some extra information on how the app works? Eventually it would be cool to let people add more than just images to their panel. Givinig a user the freedom to upload videos, text, or use URLs to link pages could be super beneficial.

## Lessons Learned:

I explored different methods for achieving an image transition effect on the Home page, utilizing keyframes to rotate between images. Also found an effective method to add a stroke effect around text using the CSS text-shadow property. Additionally, I incorporated Lightbox for the first time, allowing clients to click on photos for a closer view.
